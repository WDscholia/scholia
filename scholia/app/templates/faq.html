        <dt>How can I add information to Scholia?</dt>
        <dd>
            Scholia's information comes from <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/">Wikidata</a>
            and the English Wikipedia,
            so you should add data there.
            Use the
            <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:Search">search page in Wikidata</a> to
            examine if the data item you want to add is already in Wikidata.
            If not, add a new data item with the
            <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:NewItem">new item page</a> on the
            Wikidata site.
            <br/><br/>
            There are a number of tools to ease editing Wikidata,
            e.g. the <a href="https://author-disambiguator.toolforge.org/">Author Disambiguator</a>
            (by Arthur Smith, based on an initial version by Magnus Manske)
            that can help identify specific authors based on author name strings.

        <dt>Why is Scholia so biased and incomplete?</dt>
        <dd>Scholia's data comes mostly from Wikidata, and that data is not
            complete with respect to scientific articles, their authors, their
            citations or their annotations.
            Any scientometrics interpretation needs to keep in mind that the
            statistics might be severely biased.
            <br/><br/>
            The data entered in Wikidata are mostly incorporated from other
            databases, such as Pubmed Central and CrossRef. Works without
            DOI are less likely to be added to Wikidata because it is more
            difficult to automate the data entry. Most citations are also incorporated from other
            databases. Articles from publishers that do not release their
            citations (which can be avoided by participating in the initiative
            <a href="https://i4oc.org/">I4OC</a>) are less likely to have
            their citations entered in Wikidata. Researchers without an <a
                    href="https://orcid.org/">ORCID</a>
            and their works are not publicly available with DOI on the ORCID website are
            probably also less likely to be linked with their works on
            Wikidata.
            There are quite likely other serious biases in Wikidata.
            Scholia can help highlight some of the biases and facilitate user actions to help
            address them.
