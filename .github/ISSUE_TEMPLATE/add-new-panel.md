Scholia URLs are in the form https://scholia.toolforge.org/[aspect]/[item]#[panel]

A Scholia panel displays the result of a query on a target item in an aspect.
e.g. https://scholia.toolforge.org/topic/Q202864#publications-per-year shows the publications per year of the topic profile of Q202864 (Zika virus)

Please use the ``Add new aspect ...`` template to propose a new aspect.

**What kind of panel would you like to add to which Scholia aspect?**

**What kind of information should the panel provide, and which of the visualization options (e.g. table, bubble chart, map) should it use?**

**Which Wikidata entries would be good candidates to explore such visualizations?**

**Anything else?**
